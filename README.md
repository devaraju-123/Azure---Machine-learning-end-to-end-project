Azure ML MI@ pipe line:
=================
Prepare DAta

Train Model

Package Model

validate Model

Deploy Model

Monitor Model

____________________________
	
Azure ML service followed by below 3 phases
	1. Prepare Model: Using azure data bricks which is using spark cluster for scalable environment
	
	2. Experiment: Training  and test your model to build in your favorite IDE
	
	3. Deploy: First register and manage your model, take fully trained model packaging your docker container
		and deployed in web service with rest end point

Azure have 2 environments 
1) Training Env,

2) Deployment Env

- Azure followed to train a model in 3 choices (options)

	1- local system - small data set algo is not complicated to run in windows or linux platform with cond env

	2- Remote computers -  data centers like nvidia  GPUS, ready made clusters
	
	3-  Microsoft provide VM clusters along with cpus and gpus

install azure sdk in python

pip install azure-storage-blob

pip install azure-mgmt-storage

pip install azureml-core

steps to create sdk python azure model
- Import standard Python modules
- Import Azure ML SDK modules
- Create Azure ML Workspace
- Write configuration to local file
- Create Azure ML Experiment - for training and test data
- Freeze the model in picked model
- Test the model
- Log metrics to Azure ML Experiment
- End Azure ML Experiment
- Get Portal URLs
- Register the model
- Define Azure ML Deploymemt configuration
- Create enviroment configuration file
- Create Azure ML Scoring fileÂ¶
- Deploy the model to Azure Container Instance
- Expose web service
- Get the Web Service URL
